## Sandbox :muscle:

This is basically the **test** environment.  For a more elaborate explanation:

> A sandbox is a controlled environment that allows testing and experimentation, often used in software development to ensure the safety of changes before implementation in a production environment.

 All tests run here do NOT reflect on a real phone, they reflect on the [Africa's Talking Simulator](https://developers.africastalking.com/simulator). The sandbox app is accessed after you have [created and set up your account](/at-accountsetup/) and when landing on the *Account Dashboard*, you click on the *orange* __*Go To Sandbox App*__ at the top as shown in the image below:

The Sandbox App Dashboard is similar to the Live App Dashboard explained when setting up the account [here](/at-accountsetup/) as shown in the following image:

The following are the main differences between __*Live*__ and __*Sandbox*__:

| **Sandbox** | **Live** |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Orange** colour used in the UI | **Green** colour used in the UI |
| Username is **sandbox** | Username is **the unique username you set when creatinhg the app** |
| Account balance is **N/A** | Account balance is **the value of your account's balance** |
