Oh look, more documentation to explain the documentation! :sweat_smile:

## What's on the page?

The Africa's Talking Developers' Portal is key for devs consuming Africa's Talking APIs and is found [here](https://developers.africastalking.com/).

The portal shows various Africa's Talking products and links to tutorials, API references and other resources.

The key areas to note are:

1. **Tutorials**

![Africa's Talking Devs' Portal: Tutorials](/at-developerdocs/at-devdocsimages/at-tutorials.png)

*[Tutorials](https://developers.africastalking.com/tutorials)* provide a guide for new developers to get to test out Africa's Talking APIs in a test environment in order to learn how to use them. They are short, about *6-10 minutes* per tutorial, and are *easy to follow along*.

2. **API References**

![Africa's Talking Devs' Portal: API Reference](/at-developerdocs/at-devdocsimages/at-apiref.png)

*[API references](https://developers.africastalking.com/docs/authentication)* are used to make references for the APIs, and show details such as product overview, parameters required, sample responses and code snippets of the APIs used. An example of the code snippets (which is available in different languages as shown) is as illustrated in the image below:

3. **SDKs**

*[SDKs](https://developers.africastalking.com/sdks)* are the **first** step in using Africa's Talking APIs. In whichever language, the SDKs are installed as per the instructions illustrated on the page.

4. **Postman Collections**

Postman collections are organized sets of API requests and related information, aiding in API testing, development, and collaboration. For Africa's Talking, you can access the Postman Collections [here](https://www.postman.com/africastalking), and you can check out :pencil:[this blog](https://medium.com/africas-talking/how-to-send-data-and-receive-reports-using-africas-talking-apis-512720fe4d80) with details on how to get started with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

5. **Simulator**
